		<h2>About ReactJS Denver</h2>
		<p>ReactJS Denver was founded in April 2015 by local software engineers, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Denver/members/51267552/">ChristopheÂ­r Downard</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Denver/members/11410563/"> Will Klein</a>.</p>
		<p>Our goals:
			<ul>
				<li>ReactJS Denver is focused on Facebook's ReactJS library and the technologies and architectures surrounding it. We welcome initiates, beginners, mid-level, and experts alike. This meetup is focused on sharing successes and failures in working with
					 ReactJS and the backing stack. Come share stories, listen to talks, eat, drink, and be merry.</li>
				<li>All presentations are published online, in the hopes that it will improve the quality of presentations and offer nice exposure and incentive to present.</li>
			</ul>
			We seek to bring together the developer and designer community in Denver and cover interesting topics relevant to ReactJS web development. Come <a href="http://meetup.com/ReactJS-Denver/">join us</a> for an informative event and a great community!
